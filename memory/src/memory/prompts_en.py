ENTITY_EXTRACTION_GUIDANCE_EN = """Entity extraction rules:

Entities are not limited to traditional named entities. In this memory system, an entity is a semantic anchor that can be reused across facts for clustering, retrieval, and graph construction.
Prefer nouns or short noun phrases with long-term memory value instead of only proper names.

Allowed entity type values:
- PERSON: specific people, names, roles, or speakers mentioned in the conversation
- ORGANIZATION: companies, teams, institutions, or groups
- LOCATION: geographic locations or venues
- PRODUCT: products or services
- PROJECT: projects, product names, or long-running work items
- TECHNOLOGY: technology stacks, frameworks, libraries, tools, APIs, or systems
- CONCEPT: abstract concepts, methods, theories, or reusable ideas
- TOPIC: discussed domains or subject areas
- PREFERENCE: user preferences, likes, habits, or dislikes
- OTHER: explicitly mentioned entities that do not fit the above types

Entities that should be extracted include:
- Conversation subjects or roles, such as user, assistant, speaker_1, speaker_2, spouse, child, team, or client
- User-relevant domains, problems, tasks, states, or scenarios, such as health management, physical condition, work, business events, family education, communication, or fatigue
- Reusable plans, methods, tools, activities, or objects, such as healthy eating, family meetings, shared rules, picnics, or yoga mats
- Constraint objects or conditions that affect user choices, such as financial burden, fixed schedule, time shortage, or work pressure

Do not extract ordinary time expressions as entities, such as today, yesterday, last week, the past three days, 2026-05-07, 10:30, or three months.
Time should be stored as fact time metadata, not in the entity graph.
Only named time concepts with semantic identity may be entities, such as Spring Festival, Q3 earnings season, or Sprint 42.

Do not extract pure attributes, adjective-only phrases, isolated degree words, or generic labels as entities; keep them in fact text, keywords, topics, or states instead.
For example: low venue dependence, low intensity, high priority, low cost, strong privacy, lightweight.
If a phrase contains a reusable object or scenario, extract the core object or scenario:
- "fatigue caused by long-term high-intensity work" may yield "work" and "fatigue"
- "high-frequency business activities" may yield "business activities"
- "the financial burden is too heavy" may yield "financial burden"

Entities must come from explicit conversation content or be directly determined by a role/fact subject. Do not over-infer.
Each retained memory fact should usually include a subject entity, such as user/assistant/speaker, plus 1-4 core semantic anchors."""


EPISODE_SUMMARY_PROMPT_EN = """You are the episode aggregation module for a long-term memory system. The input contains raw interaction/transcript segments from one continuous interval and high-value facts extracted from the same evidence. Generate a narrative summary of one reviewable experience.

Input roles:
- `source_segments` are chronological source evidence and the sole primary basis for the episode's content, ordering, and stance.
- `evidence_facts` are durable coverage anchors selected from those segments. Use them only to check that important information is not missed; never rewrite, concatenate, or expand them one by one.

Conceptual boundaries:
- A fact is an independently retrievable atomic evidence unit containing precise details.
- An episode is a higher-level narrative of what happened during one continuous experience: what unfolded, what it centered on, and what conclusion or open point remained.
- An episode is not a long-term state, user profile, cross-experience pattern, risk assessment, or actionable item. Never generalize one episode into a durable conclusion.

Generation rules:
1. Reconstruct the experience from source segments: context/trigger -> discussion, observation, or action -> meaningful turn or stance -> result, decision, or unresolved point. Omit any unsupported step.
2. Abstract related expressions, but do not replay every turn or write one sentence per fact. The summary must be more coherent and contextual than the facts, not a longer fact list.
3. Ignore wake words, greetings, courtesy closings, repetitions, empty acknowledgements, and templated assistant language. Retain only the people/objects, setting, issue, user concern, key response, decision, constraint, outcome, or open question needed to understand the experience.
4. Cover high-value information in `evidence_facts` where it agrees with source segments. If facts conflict with, overstate, or leave ambiguity in the source, follow the source and preserve uncertainty.
5. Preserve chronology, conditions, and speaker stance. Do not turn advice into a decision, a possibility or plan into completion, an assistant view into a user belief, or invent causality, owners, deadlines, or outcomes.
6. If the continuous interval contains several unrelated but valuable topics, connect them with a structured summary without forcing a causal link or omitting important content.
7. summary must be one concise, self-contained experience narrative: understandable without source segments and clear about the central people/objects, progression, and conclusion/open point.
8. title is a short, concrete, distinguishable retrieval title. Prefer "object + core event/problem/decision" over broad labels.
9. canonical_topics contains only 1-3 stable topics. Prefer `fact_root_topic` values from evidence facts; never use an action, one-off conclusion, emotion, or isolated keyword as a topic.
10. Return JSON matching the schema exactly. No markdown, explanation, or extra fields.

Output schema:

  "title": "short specific title",
  "summary": "self-contained episode summary",

UNIFIED_MEMORY_EXTRACTION_PROMPT_EN = """You are the memory extraction module for a unified AI-glasses memory system inspired by MemPalace.

Current memory structure:
- fact: a traceable, self-contained, independently retrievable narrative evidence unit extracted from a continuous evidence batch. Facts are persisted first and may be assigned to an episode later.
- episode: a higher-level experience summary generated by a separate module from persisted raw interaction/transcript segments in one continuous interval; newly generated facts are coverage anchors only, so it is not a copy of each input batch or fact.
- memory_topic_items: a reusable topic naming registry populated from stored facts and episodes. It contains canonical topics and fact aspects, not a topic summary or state.
- entity_claim: a traceable entity proposition projected from facts by a separate reflection task; it is not direct evidence from the current dialogue.
- goal / plan / work_item: future desired outcomes, explicit arrangements, and closed-loop responsibilities extracted by a separate Intent & Execution task after facts are stored. Do not output them here.

Your task now is to extract Hindsight-style high-quality narrative facts from the chronological dialogue/transcript evidence batch below. Episode summary and episode canonical_topics are generated by a separate module from persisted source segments with extracted facts as coverage anchors; do not output episode-level fields in this prompt.

Topic and entity rules:
- A fact's `fact_root_topic` must be grounded in the main durable issue in current evidence, while `fact_aspect_topic` keeps the concrete aspect under that root. Use a conservative, specific topic when evidence is limited.
- Every fact must also output one `primary_entity`, the single entity that the fact mainly describes, affects, or belongs to; it must be one object, not an array.
- `primary_entity` must come from the fact's `entities`. Do not choose an entity merely because it is mentioned, provides a recommendation, or is a location, tool, or background context. For a multi-person exchange, choose the person or entity mainly described or affected by the fact; for a fact about the user's own preference, habit, constraint, or risk, choose the user.
- Keep `entities` for all directly relevant entities so retrieval preserves participants and context; downstream entity-state matching uses only `primary_entity`, so one fact must not be assigned to multiple entities.

""" + ENTITY_EXTRACTION_GUIDANCE_EN + """

Core Hindsight-style narrative fact requirements:
- Each fact should cover a complete exchange or a clear topic segment, not a single utterance. Do not mechanically split "the user raised a problem", "the assistant suggested a solution", and "the user accepted/rejected it" into separate fragments; if they respond to the same issue, merge them into one narrative fact.
- Each fact must be understandable without reading the original dialogue and preserve the pragmatic flow of the interaction: why the user raised the issue, what the assistant suggested, how the user responded, and what preference, decision, constraint, unresolved question, or next step emerged.
- Each fact must naturally include the five dimensions in its text: what (complete event/topic/plan/conclusion), when (conversation timestamp or explicit time anchor), where (location/setting/platform/project scope; if absent, say no specific location/setting was mentioned), who (user, assistant, and other key people/organizations with their roles), and why (explicit reason, motivation, concern, disagreement, constraint, implication, conclusion, or follow-up).
- For a roughly five-turn dialogue batch or a coherent multi-speaker transcript segment, usually produce 1-3 facts. Only split when the batch truly contains multiple unrelated events/topics. In most cases, do not exceed 5 facts.

fact_type classification:
- `fact_type` describes the fact's primary semantic role. It must be one of preference, decision, request, recommendation, action, commitment, open_question, risk, error, context, instruction, or other.
- Choose the one category that best represents the fact's memory value. Do not use `open_question` merely because the assistant did not answer or the user's wording is vague.

Temporal fidelity requirements:
- Preserve sequence and ordering expressions exactly when they affect meaning: first, first time, second, previous, next, later, earlier, before, after, once, again, subsequent, prior, last, most recent, and similar wording. Do not paraphrase away order. For example, keep "serviced for the first time on March 15" rather than reducing it to "had a good service experience".
- Preserve relative time expressions in text and keywords: yesterday, last Saturday, previous week, two months ago, about a month ago, mid-February, recently, shortly after, and similar phrases. If the expression can be resolved unambiguously from the Conversation timestamp, write the resolved real-world event time directly into `event_time_key`.
- The `Time` shown for each segment is the dialogue/transcript timestamp. It is only the reference anchor for resolving relative event times, not the default event time for the fact. Derive `event_time_key` from the specific event described by the fact and the temporal evidence in the text; do not copy the dialogue timestamp merely because the event was discussed at that time.
- `event_time_key` is the most representative real-world occurrence time or temporal anchor for the event described by the fact. It is not the dialogue time, extraction time, or current system time. It is a single time field; do not output an event end time, interval, or additional start/end time fields.
- Use this priority when deriving time: explicit absolute date/time in the evidence > a relative expression that can be resolved unambiguously from the segment `Time` > an event explicitly described as happening during the current conversation. For example, with dialogue time 2023-05-30, `last month (around April 2023)` should resolve to a representative time around 2023-04 rather than 2023-05-30; `last weekend (May 27-28)` should use a representative time around 2023-05-27; only an event explicitly described as decided/completed today should use 2023-05-30.
- If a fact describes both a current conversational act and an earlier background event, use the time of the event the fact primarily describes; split the fact when necessary instead of allowing the dialogue timestamp to overwrite the earlier event time. If only a month, weekend, or relative period is supported, preserve the original expression in text/keywords and use a conservative representative time anchor in `event_time_key`.
- Prefer explicit dates, times, weekdays, and relative time expressions from the evidence. Resolve a relative expression to an absolute time only when the current segment `Time` makes the resolution unambiguous; otherwise do not guess, leave `event_time_key` empty, and set `time_confidence` to `unknown`. Never fabricate an event time from the dialogue timestamp, current time, or extraction time.
- If one fact contains multiple events with different times, split them into separate facts instead of using one event time to hide unrelated events.
- If an event's answerability depends on temporal order, the fact text must include both the event object and the time anchor or order marker. Do not store only the topic name.
- If multiple events in the batch may later be compared by before/after/first/which happened earlier, either keep them in one narrative fact that explicitly states their relative order, or split them into separate complete facts with their own time anchors. Avoid keeping only one side of a comparison.
- Personal events mentioned as side context remain important when they include time anchors or ordering words, such as purchases, service/maintenance, repairs, appointments, attendance, travel, meetings, tests, failures, and decisions.

Rules:
1. Extract 0-5 facts. Do not force a fact for every turn.
2. Each fact must be a complete narrative preserving the essential topic background plus the flow of user/assistant views or actions and an explicit reason, disagreement, constraint, conclusion, or next step.
3. Preserve concrete answerable details: names, places, titles, colors, dates, weekdays, relative times, numbers, amounts, durations, products, organizations, recommendations, constraints, decisions, and user preferences.
4. Do not drop personal events mentioned as asides, e.g. "by the way", "I also", "I just", "last Saturday", "two months ago"; but if they are context inside the same exchange, merge them into the same narrative fact instead of emitting context-free short notes.
5. Split only truly unrelated events. Events that must be compared for temporal reasoning may be split, but every split fact must still preserve its own background and time anchor.
6. Use only the dialogue evidence. Do not invent completion, intent, or reasons.
7. Keep assistant recommendations that contain concrete future-answerable items inside the relevant exchange narrative, and include whether the user accepted, rejected, hesitated, or added constraints when supported.
8. priority is 0-100. Keep only facts worth at least 60.
9. fact_type must be preference, decision, request, recommendation, action, commitment, open_question, risk, error, context, instruction, or other.
10. Do not output short facts like "the user said X" or "the assistant suggested Y". If deleting the topic background, reason, disagreement, or conclusion would make the text a vague short note, add those details back; if the dialogue does not support them, omit the fact.
11. Do not store assistant pleasantries, generic closings, or low-information encouragement as standalone facts, e.g. "hope this helps", "let me know if you have other questions", "okay", or "you're welcome", unless they explicitly change a decision, commitment, or next step.
12. keywords must be short retrieval terms: entities, topics, symptoms, plans, constraints, decisions, and important time/order anchors. For time-sensitive facts, include the original or resolved time phrase such as "March 15 2023", "first service", "3/22", "last Saturday", or "two months ago". Do not put full sentences, pleasantries, filler, generic encouragement, or phrases like "hope this method helps you" into keywords.
13. Return JSON only. No markdown.

entity_claim_signal rules:
- `entity_claim_signal` is a structured evidence hint from this fact for entity claims in the personal world model. It is not a final claim and must not decide its relation to existing claims.
- `signal_kind` must be one of: `explicit_assertion` (a durable proposition directly stated by an entity or confirmed by a reliable record), or `pattern_observation` (an observation that may later support one directionally specific pattern together with other episodes).
- `claim_type_hint` must be one of: identity_profile, affiliation, relationship, preference, constraint, behavior_pattern. A single action must not become an explicit_assertion for behavior_pattern; at most it is a pattern_observation.
- `claim_anchor` is a short, stable grouping label that can collect facts from different episodes about one possible claim or pattern, such as "quiet travel preference" or "swimming routine". It is neither a sentence nor the final entity claim.
- Output signals only when this fact has concrete evidence value for an entity claim or later pattern induction. Use an empty array for one-off background, temporary suggestions, assistant speculation, pleasantries, and low-value content.
- Return at most 3 signals per fact. Every signal must contain entity, signal_kind, claim_type_hint, claim_anchor, evidence_basis, and confidence. evidence_basis must cite the current fact, never a prior claim.

prospective_signals rules:
- `prospective_signals` are structured hints that this fact is evidence about the user's future world. They are not final goals, plans, or work items, and must not directly create, update, or override an existing object.
- Output a signal only when this fact directly supports a user's future-facing goal, arrangement, responsibility, or a lifecycle change such as completion, cancellation, rescheduling, or blockage. Otherwise output an empty array.
- `evidence_kind` must be one of goal, plan, responsibility, or lifecycle_update. `candidate_object_types` may contain only goal, plan, and work_item. A goal may be signalled only by the user's own explicit durable goal expression.
- `user_role` must be owner, participant, or responsible: the user respectively owns the goal, participates in the arrangement, or bears the responsibility. Do not output a signal when the user is merely mentioned.
- `assertion_source` must be self_statement, third_party_report, or observed_event; `explicitness` must be direct, reported, or tentative. Assistant suggestions or restatements, open hypotheticals, conditional discussion, and speculation never create signals.
- `prospective_anchor` is a short, stable grouping label for the goal, event, or responsibility, such as "Tianjin client meeting", "half-marathon training goal", or "client report delivery". It is not a full sentence or the final object description.
- `operation_hint` must be create, confirm, update, complete, cancel, reschedule, or block. Use a non-create value only when the fact directly states that lifecycle change.
- Return at most 2 signals per fact. Every signal must include subject_entity, evidence_kind, candidate_object_types, operation_hint, user_role, prospective_anchor, assertion_source, explicitness, evidence_basis, and confidence. evidence_basis must be concrete evidence in this fact.

RECALL_QUERY_ANALYSIS_PROMPT_EN = """You are the recall query analyzer for the AI-glasses long-term memory system.

Understand the memory structure before analyzing the query. 

Memory structure:
1. `fact`: traceable, self-contained narrative evidence extracted from one conversation episode or all-day transcript. It preserves what happened, participants, time, place or scene, reasons, viewpoint changes, suggestions, acceptance or rejection, constraints, conclusions, and unresolved questions. Facts usually include `summary`, `keywords`, `entities`, `fact_root_topic`, `fact_aspect_topic`, `event_time_key`, and `dialogue_time_key`.
2. `entity_claim`: a statusful, confidence-weighted entity proposition reflected from facts, such as a stable preference, routine, relationship, background, constraint, or characteristic. It remains traceable to supporting facts.
3. `goal`, `plan`, and `work_item`: future-oriented objects extracted from facts, respectively representing a desired outcome, an explicit arrangement, and a closed-loop responsibility. Their status and target/start/due times are meaningful.
4. `episode`: a continuous-experience summary used only as an association boundary between facts. It must never be a direct recall object.

Guidance:
- Use `source_types` only when the query clearly points to assistant_wakeup interactions or allday_recording transcripts. Otherwise use both.
- `recall_object_types` lists object types eligible for direct retrieval. It must always include `fact`; add `entity_claim` only for explicit stable-entity-knowledge questions; add the relevant `goal`, `plan`, or `work_item` only for future goals, arrangements, responsibilities, deadlines, unfinished work, or their lifecycle. Never output `episode`.
- Prefer `fact` for what happened, dates, places, people, exact evidence, event order, and traceable details.
- For stable preferences, durable constraints, routines, relationships, or profiles, add `entity_claim` alongside the supporting facts.
- For tasks, commitments, future arrangements, goals, deadlines, or unfinished work, add the relevant prospective object alongside the supporting facts.
- Keep the plan broad when unsure. Missing evidence is worse than retrieving a few extra candidates.
- Extract 2-8 short retrieval keywords, prioritizing concrete people, organizations, products, projects, topics, actions, outcomes, and constraints. Do not output full sentences, pleasantries, generic words, or ordinary time expressions.
- Extract useful semantic entities with names and types. Entities may be people, organizations, locations, products, projects, technologies, or concrete concepts; ordinary time expressions such as today, yesterday, or last week are not entities.
- `temporal_mode` selects which fact timestamp should be used for a time range: `event_time` means the real-world event time described by the fact, `dialogue_time` means when the conversation/transcript occurred, `both` means either timestamp may match, and `none` means no hard time filter. Prefer `event_time` for queries asking what happened, was done, bought, or visited; prefer `dialogue_time` for queries asking what was discussed, mentioned, or asked; use `none` when the temporal intent is unclear.
- Parse `temporal_bounds` from the original query using the reference time. Use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` or `null` for `start` / `end`, and provide at least one bound. `end` is exclusive. Output `null` when no time constraint applies.
- Set `is_prospective_time_slot_query` to true only when the user asks for the set or status of their own current/future arrangements, plans, to-dos, or unfinished responsibilities in a time window. It is false for external information, advice, a single-fact confirmation, a prediction, or an immediate command such as creating a reminder.
